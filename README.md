WinForms Application to help manage tasks received by SalesForce in Unit4 Customer Support (multi-threading + Selenium to automate tasks)

4fun made application using WinForms. It is the first time I used Selenium within an application.
I learned a lot about the automated tests while creating it.
I made also a lot of refactoring while working on the application, since it started as a quiet silly joke, but turned out to be a some-what useful tool for the Support.
