4fun made application using WinForms and Selenium.

It is the first time I used Selenium within an application.

I learned a lot about the automated tests while creating it.
I made also a lot of refactoring while working on the application, since it started as a quiet silly joke, but turned out to be a some-what useful tool for the Support.

This also gave me an oppurtunity to play with multi-threading within one application.
